We can view the top 15 words by using the `takeOrdered()` action; however, since the elements of the RDD are pairs, we need a custom sort function that sorts using the value part of the pair.\n","#### You'll notice that many of the words are common English words. These are called stopwords. In a later lab, we will see how to eliminate them from the results.\n","#### Use the `wordCount()` function and `takeOrdered()` to obtain the fifteen most common words and their counts."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"whtGuf4CEkS4"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TODO: Replace <FILL IN> with appropriate code\n","top15WordsAndCounts = <FILL IN>\n","print('\\n'.join(map(lambda w : '{0}'.format(w), top15WordsAndCounts)))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"tNQ_aMsXEkS5"},"outputs":[],"source":["# TEST Count the words (4f)\n","Test.assertEquals(top15WordsAndCounts,\n","                  [(u'the', 27361), (u'and', 26028), (u'i', 20681), (u'to', 19150), (u'of', 17463),\n","                   (u'a', 14593), (u'you', 13615), (u'my', 12481), (u'in', 10956), (u'that', 10890),\n","                   (u'is', 9134), (u'not', 8497), (u'with', 7771), (u'me', 7769), (u'it', 7678)],\n","                  'incorrect value for top15WordsAndCounts')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 5: clean your workspace"],"metadata":{"id":"IDqeeN43qd14"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Remove test_helper\n","!rm -r test_helper\n","\n","# Remove Spark folder\n","!rm -rf spark-3.4.0-bin-hadoop3\n","\n","# Remove data\n","!rm -r data"],"metadata":{"id":"nf-hgt0IqcCG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls"],"metadata":{"id":"-megQp7QqkDA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["UAvUqBvGEkSu"],"provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
